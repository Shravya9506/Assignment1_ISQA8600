## About ReadMe
This is an assignment for the course ISQA 8600 to practice writing ReadMe file using Markdown. Let's understand what a ReadMe file is? Imagine that you want to drive a car but does not know how to do it because you need some basic instructions on how to start the engine, which foot peddle is the brake and which one is the accelerator. Similar the ReadMe file gives clear instructions about the project. As the name suggests, this is the first file that one should read when one wants to use or understand the project.  Simply put, **_ReadMe.md is a collection of essential project information and a kind of guidebook._**

The purpose of a good README is for others to understand what our code contains and why it's important. So a good amount of time needs to be spent in writing the file. Markdown is a markup language that is used for text formatting the ReadMe file and hence the extension '.md'. 

## Learning Process
Steps I followed to learn and write this ReadMe file:
* Learned, practiced and completed the [Markdown tutorial.](http://www.markdowntutorial.com)
* Read [this](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project) article and learned a few tips.
* Looked at some very good ReadMe examples
  * [Pomolectron](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/pomolectron) 
  * [Vue Timepicker](https://github.com/phoenixwong/vue2-timepicker/blob/master/README.md)
